1 error prohibited this job from being saved:
Customer must exist

This means you haven't created a migration for the foreign key. 
e.g. job needs customer_id:references 
rails g migration AddCustomerToJobs customer:references

You need not use the numeric ID's in your RESTful routes. Look at permalink_fu, and use the :permalink field rather than the :id to refer to each gallery resource.

job.customer.name = working in console 
job.customer.name = NOT working in jobs#index 

reason was because the customer and designer fields were not populated for pre-exissting
records in the database. Deleting those records solved the problem. 

Nil error message for 
job.customer.name
job.designer.name
